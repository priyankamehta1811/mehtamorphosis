## About Me

Hi, I'm Priyanka Mehta, a bioinformatician specializing in genomics, transcriptomics, and data analysis of RNA viruses. My research focuses on host-pathogen interactions, viral adaptation, and disease severity through transcriptomic data, single-cell sequencing, and metagenomics.

Explore my work and projects through my **[Streamlit Portfolio]([link-to-your-streamlit-portfolio](https://mehtamorphosis.streamlit.app)**, where I showcase my skills in bioinformatics, data visualization, and computational biology.
