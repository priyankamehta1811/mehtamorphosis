## About Me

Hi, I'm Priyanka Mehta, a bioinformatician specializing in genomics, transcriptomics, and data analysis of RNA viruses. My research focuses on host-pathogen interactions, viral adaptation, and disease severity through transcriptomic data, single-cell sequencing, and metagenomics.

Check out my Streamlit Portfolio **[mehtamorphosis.streamlit.app](https://mehtamorphosis.streamlit.app)**, to explore my skills, academic adventures, hobbies, and publications. It’s where I combine science with creativity, and I’m excited to share my journey with you!

P.S. Theme is inspired by Cyberpunk 2077!
